Welcome to the initial release of the fast-jsonl library!

What is fast-jsonl?

It's a small library for quickly reading JSONL data files.
It works by storing the byte position of each line in the JSONL file to a
disk-based cache and then loading only specific lines into memory when needed.
This works great for machine learning and data science workflows that rely on
(usually semi-)random access to huge datasets that may be too large to fit
into memory.

Getting Started
---------------

Install with pip:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install fast-jsonl

And simply pass the path to your JSONL file to the fast-jsonl Reader class and
index or slice the reader as if it is a data array:

.. code-block:: python

   import fast_jsonl as fj

   data = fj.Reader("path-to-file.jsonl")

   # get any instance by index
   instance = data[0]

   # get slices of data
   instances = data[:10]
   instances_rev = data[:10:-1]

Multiple JSONL files can be combined into a single dataset using the
MultiReader class:

.. code-block:: python

   import fast_jsonl as fj

   data = fj.MultiReader(["path-to-file1.jsonl", "path-to-file2.jsonl"])

If your JSONL file has changed on disk, re-initialize the reader with
`force_cache=True` to force generation of a new cache:

.. code-block:: python

   import fast_jsonl as fj

   data = fj.Reader("path-to-file.jsonl", force_cache=True)
